Loop to end of the system data

  - get the correct process

  - get the correct op code

  - test mode

     - check for 'I'

         - load timer with the data
	   - and call it

         - set my process to blocked

         - call output operation

     - check for 'O'

         - load timer with the data
	   - and call it

         - set my process to blocked

         - call output operation

     - check for 'M'  // if

         - running MMU

         - potential seg fault of process

     - check for 'P'

         - calculate one cycle

         - call output operation (running)

         - loop up to num cycles or quantum 
           (one cycle at a time)

           - timer

           - check for interrupt

         - if interrupt, then move context back process manager

            - call output operation (interrupt)

         - else

            - report end quantum or end run cycles


     check for interrupt(s), resolve

  - end master loop


TIMER:

   - time
   - process #, desc text
